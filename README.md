[Nomisma.org](http://nomisma.org) is a dataset of numismatic datasets. We provide them `voID.rdf`, which points to our RDF `princeton-nomisma.rdf` hosted here on GitHub. This script collects data from the PUL catalog, combines it with a CSV generated by the PUL Numismatics team, and generates an XML that follows Nomisma's ontology.

## Notes

- The location of `princeton-nomisma.rdf` should not be changed unless `voID.rdf` is updated and given to Nomisma.
- If `princeton-nomisma.rdf` is updated with new data, Nomisma should be contacted to run another ingestion. Preferably, do not contact them more than once every month.
